## GnuCash settings

If you are on Windows or Linux: choose the Preference option from the Edit menu.
On a Mac, choose the Preferences option from the GnuCash menu.

Make sure that you check the tab "Numbers, Date, Time" and verify that the Date Format setting is set to `Europe`.

Switch to the "Business" tab and mark the options "Enable extra buttons" and "Tax included" on both Invoices and Bills if they are not already marked.
Set the option `Report for printing` to `Tax Invoice`. This will give you a valid invoice including all obligatory fields.
