Add the following options and click OK.

* **Company Name**: The name of your company
* **Company address**: The address of your company. Also add the IBAN bank account number on a separate line. In this way both items will appear on invoices. If you leave two empty lines between the address and bank account number, it looks a bit better on the printed invoice.
* **Company Contact Persoon**: Your name of the name of a colleague
* **Company Phone Number**: Your telephone number
* **Company Email Address**: Your company e-mail address
* **Company ID**: In the Dutch system the VAT id
* **Company Website URL**: Your website or any other company profile, such as LinkedIn or Facebook
* **Fancy Date Format**: Select Europe. The date will be printed on invoices and reports.
* **Months**: Name
* **Years**: Mark "Include Century"
