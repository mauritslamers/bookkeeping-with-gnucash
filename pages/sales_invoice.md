## Sales invoice

Making and sending invoices: that is what it is about for entrepreneurs. But what need to be on an invoice?
How do you keep track of unpaid invoices?

## What needs to be on an invoice?

_NOTE: This is written from the context of the Dutch tax environment. It might be that requirements are different elsewhere._

An invoice needs to fulfill a few requirements:

* Company name and address
- Name and address of the customer
- Customer number
- VAT ID
- Number or ID of the trade register from the Chamber of Commerce
- Invoice number: invoice numbers need to be numbered incrementally
- Invoice date
- Clear description of the delivered goods or services, optionally with a date of delivery. It is a good custom to have separate lines on the invoice for different things, such as separate lines for materials and work. An invoice which is clear reduces the chance of a late payment.
- Per product or service the quantity
- Per product or service the amount without VAT
- Per product or service the VAT rate
- The discount percentage if it is a gross price
- The discount percentage if the discount is given on the whole invoice
- VAT percentage 21%, 9%, 0% or no VAT for trades without VAT
- VAT amount per rate
- Total amount
- Billing terms
- Payment method

The invoices created with GnuCash fulfill these requirements. Moreover, there is the option to view the generated invoices and save them as PDF.
