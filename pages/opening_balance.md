## Entering the Opening balance (or starting balance
The opening balance (also called starting balance) is the start of an accounting system.
We will give two methods, one for a new accounting system and one for an existing accounting system.

If you are just starting, or you have been working for a while but did not set up an accounting system yet, 
[New opening balance]({{ site.baseurl}}/opening_balance/new_balance) is the best place to start.

Otherwise you check out the example of the [Existing administration]({{ site.baseurl}}/opening_balance/existing_balance)
